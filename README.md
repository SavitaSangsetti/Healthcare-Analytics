# Healthcare-Analytics
1.Overview:
In today’s data-driven world, the healthcare sector stands to gain significantly from advanced analytics. The Healthcare Analytics Project is designed to harness the power of data to improve patient outcomes, streamline clinical and administrative operations, and support evidence-based decision-making.
By analyzing a rich dataset comprising information on patients, doctors, visits, treatments, and lab results, the project uncovers meaningful insights into healthcare delivery and system performance. Through the use of powerful visualization tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, interactive dashboards have been developed to highlight key metrics such as patient demographics, treatment outcomes, lab abnormalities, and healthcare costs.
By identifying areas for improvement, the project supports continuous enhancement of patient care and operational efficiency across the healthcare system.

2.KPI's:
Total Patients: 10,000 – Reflects the overall reach of healthcare services.
Total Doctors: 1,000 – Indicates the size of the medical workforce.
Total Visits: 10,000 – Tracks patient engagement and service demand.
Total Lab Tests Conducted: 10,000 – Measures diagnostic activity levels.
Average Patient Age: 48.94 years – Offers insights into the patient population profile.
Treatment Cost per Visit: $2,541 – Helps evaluate cost efficiency.
Follow-Up Rate: 49.84% – Indicates continuity of care and monitoring.
Abnormal Lab Results: 49.2% – Flags potential health concerns in the population.
Average Patients per Doctor: 10 – Shows workload distribution among doctors.

3.Insights:
The data shows that most patients are around 49 years old with a balanced gender ratio. Only 33% of treatments are successful, and nearly half of all lab results are abnormal, indicating a need for better care and early diagnosis. CT scans and X-rays are the most used tests. General Medicine is the most common doctor specialization. There are inconsistencies in treatment cost data across tools. States like Texas, Florida, and New York have the highest patient numbers.

4.Recommendations:
Improve treatment success rates by reviewing care protocols. Promote preventive health programs to catch issues early. Allocate more specialists in less-covered areas. Strengthen follow-up systems through reminders or telehealth. Standardize cost reporting for consistency. Increase healthcare services in high-demand states to better serve patient needs.

5.Conclusion:
This Healthcare Analytics Project provided valuable insights into patient demographics, treatment outcomes, lab test results, and healthcare resource distribution. By leveraging tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, we were able to identify key areas for improvement such as treatment effectiveness, cost management, and preventive care. The analysis highlights the importance of data-driven strategies in enhancing healthcare delivery and optimizing operational efficiency. With the right interventions and continuous monitoring, healthcare providers can significantly improve patient outcomes and overall service quality.
